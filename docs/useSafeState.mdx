# useSafeState

Update the state only while mounted `useState`

## Usage

Before updating the value, check if it is unmounted. This avoids no-op
leaks.

This can be used in place of `useState`, but should not replace all
`useState`.
It has a very small overhead, so use it only if you want to update
the state during asynchronous processing.

```tsx
import { useSafeState } from 'react-hookable'
const [state, setState] = useSafeState()
```
